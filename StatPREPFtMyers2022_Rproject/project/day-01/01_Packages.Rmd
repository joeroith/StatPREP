## Your Workspace

This is an R Markdown document. It has the convenience of combining a text editor (like Word or Google Docs) with R for writing and executing code directly in the document. The code sections are distinguished by *chunks* like the one below.

```{r}
1+1
10^3

# Anything in this chunk can be run through R. Unless the line has a '#' in
#  front, this signifies a comment.

# Press the green play arrow on the upper right side of this chunk. 
# How much code ran?
# Place your cursor on the 1+1 line and press 'Ctrl/Cmd' + 'Enter/Return'.
# Now how much code ran?
```

Statisticians use these documents as a workspace for writing, editing, commenting, organizing, and publishing their data analysis. We even create professional looking documents with simple tricks for creating **bold** or *italic* emphasis, among other things. Look for the **Knit** button at the top of the pane, click it and watch RStudio knit text and code seamlessly together.

You can use documents like this in your classroom as worksheets with background information, learning content, and ready to run code. We will show some more examples of how we use Rmd files in our classrooms tomorrow.

## Packages

Most often we use these documents to work on code in an organized place. Since R is open sourced, anyone can write their own specialized functions. If we want to use code someone else created, we need to download and install their packages.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# You do not need to run this code today, the packages are already
#  installed in this project.
# Once you start your own projects or download RStudio desktop, you will
#  need to run lines like this.

# This package contains some useful functions for plots and descriptive 
#  stats.
install.packages("mosaic")    

# This one contains a bunch of other useful packages all rolled together.
install.packages("tidyverse") 

# Packages only need to be installed once per project on RStudio Cloud and
#  once ever on RStudio Desktop.
```

In order to use the functions in those packages, you need to load them into your current session. Most documents with R code have a `setup` R chunk like this at the beginning where they load all of the package they will need.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# Writing these lines is not enough, you need to run them first
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)
```

It's not uncommon to have a dozen or more packages loaded right at the beginning of your code.
